# booth/delilah — Delilah's 5th birthday + Rosh Hashanah 5787 (2026-09-11)

Personal home-party photo booth. iPad on a stand, Canon Selphy over AirPrint.
Every kept shot produces TWO prints (the party favors): the real photo, and a
storybook version where Gemini repaints the guests into a Rosh Hashanah
pomegranate orchard with faces preserved. Guests can optionally type a cell
number to get both texted as well.

Forked from `booth/` (Sage Oak) with HubSpot, email, consent and roles removed.
No cron, so no SUNSET is needed: nothing runs unattended.

| File | What | Where it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `index.html` | Booth front-end (camera, countdown, framed 1200x1800 print, name+phone, auto-print, host album) | Cloudflare Pages `delilah-booth` |
| `worker.js` | `POST /submit` archives a print in KV and texts it via JustCall MMS; `POST /storybook` sends the un-framed capture to Gemini and returns the repaint; `GET /photo/<key>`; `GET /photos` | Cloudflare Worker `delilah-booth` |
| `wrangler.toml` | Worker vars: `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, `JUSTCALL_FROM`, `SMS_BODY` | |
| `test-worker.mjs` | `node test-worker.mjs` | |

## Host controls

- **Album / reprints:** on the start screen, press and hold the top-right corner
  for about a second. Every archived photo shows with a Reprint button, plus
  Print all.
- **Auto-print off:** set `AUTO_PRINT: false` in `CONFIG` inside `public/index.html`.
- **Storybook off:** set `STORYBOOK: false` in the same `CONFIG` (one print per guest again).

## Storybook print (favor 2)

Flow per guest: real photo prints and is texted, then a "Painting your storybook"
screen while the Worker calls `gemini-3.1-flash-image` with the capture as a
reference image and the prompt in `worker.js` (`STORYBOOK_PROMPT`). About 10 s.
The page frames the result in the same card with the banner "Once upon a Shana
Tova", prints it, archives it (`kind: storybook` in the album) and texts it with
`STORYBOOK_SMS_BODY`. Any Gemini failure is skipped silently: the guest already
has print 1 and the done screen says to ask Roman for the storybook later.
Secret: `wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY`. Model is `GEMINI_MODEL` in
`wrangler.toml`.

## Sender number

Roman asked for "the 6793 number". No JustCall number ends in 6793. The Worker
sends from 818-573-6293 ("Roman's line", MMS-capable, same number the EO booth
used). Change `JUSTCALL_FROM` in `wrangler.toml` and redeploy if that is wrong.

## Deploy

```bash
cd booth/delilah
npx wrangler kv namespace create DELILAH_PHOTOS      # paste id into wrangler.toml
npx wrangler deploy
npx wrangler secret put JUSTCALL_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put JUSTCALL_API_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY
# The page is served by the Worker from public/ ([assets]); there is no Pages project.
```

## Day-of checklist

1. iPad: Settings > Safari > Camera > Allow for delilah-booth.pages.dev. Add the
   page to the Home Screen so it runs full-screen.
2. Selphy on the same Wi-Fi. First print: pick the Selphy in the iOS print sheet,
   paper size 4x6 (Postcard), then it stays selected.
3. Take one test shot, confirm both prints and both texts arrive. Two print
   sheets per guest: the host taps Print on each.
4. After the party: `GET /photos` on the Worker lists every archived shot for a
   family album; nothing needs tearing down.
